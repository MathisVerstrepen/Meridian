GLOBAL_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """When you need to write LaTeX, use the following format:  
- For **inline math**: ' $...$ ' (a new line must appear immediately before the opening '$', and a space must appear immediately after the closing '$')  
- For **block math**: ' $$...$$ ' (include a space before the opening '$$', and a space after the closing '$$')  

Where '...' represents your LaTeX code.  

**Key Requirements:**  
1- For **inline math**, a new line **must** appear immediately before the opening '$'.
2- For **block math**, a space **must** appear immediately before the opening '$$'.
3- A space **must** appear immediately after the closing '$' (or '$$') for both.  

**Examples:**  
- Correct inline: ' The formula for relativity is:
 $E=mc^2$ '
- Correct block: ' Consider: $$ \int_a^b f(x)dx $$ '  
- **Incorrect**: 'Missing($spaces$)' (missing newline/space before '$' and/or space after '$') or '$$isolated$$' (no surrounding spaces)"""
